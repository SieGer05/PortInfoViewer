Port Information Lookup Tool
============================

This is a simple command-line tool that allows you to look up information about network ports. It reads port information from a file named "ports.txt" and provides details about a specific port entered by the user.

Features:
- Read port information from "ports.txt"
- Insert port information into a binary search tree
- Search for port information by port number
- Display detailed port information if found

Usage:
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
2. Make sure you have a file named "ports.txt" in the same directory.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the program.
4. Enter a port number to retrieve information about that port.

Note:
- Port information should be in the format: "portNumber|name|type|description|category"
